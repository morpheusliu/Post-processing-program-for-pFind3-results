# Post-processing-program-for-pFind3-results
For providing the site-centric quantification data, the output reports from pFind® 3 need to be further processed (i) to remove peptides matched to decoy protein hits and common contaminates; (ii) to remove peptides bearing more than one probe-derived modifications; (iii) to set a cut off value for sigma score to remove those quantification results interfered by coeluting isobaric signals during LC-MS/MS analysis; (iv) to assign the position number of cysteine site on protein sequences; (iv) to group the quantification ratios of those peptide matches (e.g., different charge states, normal and missed cleavage, with and without methionine oxidation) that can assign the same modified cysteine site, with the median value reported as the final ratio. To facilitate these processes, here we described an open-access algorithm based on pythonTM for automatic post-processing of the pFind® 3 searching results.
1. System requirements:
This algorithm was developed by python3 and tested on python 3.7.3. Windows® is the uniqie operating system for this algorithm.
2. Installation guide:
Python3 with a latest version or any version higher than 3.7.3 should be installed (https://www.python.org/). Please make sure that python has been added to the path when installed （please check the picture 'python installation' in folder 'Instructions'）.
